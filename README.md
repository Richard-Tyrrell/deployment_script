# deployment_script
This was a script I developed with my group working on a project at NJIT in my final semester. The pupose of the script was to simulate deployment to different enviroments by reinventing the wheel. This script utilizes mysql server, python, OS library for python, and zipfile for python. The goal was to copy files from a development enviroment to a QA then to Production. The script utilizes STD for the choice statements on the deployment machine. The deployment machine hosts the mysql-server for labeling the packages a pass or fail. The machine also houses all the versions but only deploys the most recent or in the case of a rollback the first version that was marked as pass which is represented as a 1.

The table needed in the database is version(ID int primary key auto_increment NOT NULL, name varchar(255) NOT NULL, passfail NULL). This is all that is needed at it's core. The script with use mysql-connector-python to connect to the database and insert the data into the table.
